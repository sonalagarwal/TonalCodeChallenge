# Android Version Targeting

The application is currently built to work with Android API 26. However, App's minimum SDK support is Android API 14.

# What the Application Does

The Application fetches last five days weather(Every 3 hours) information and displays the Min/Max Temp and average humidity
for each day.

# Things which can be improved

1) UI only shows proof of concept and can be improved
2) Did not test the application for landscape mode.
3) Could have written more unit test cases specially around view model. Skipped this as did not want to spend more than 2-3 hours on the app development.
